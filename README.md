## Windows Notes

Voice parameter is not yet available. Uses whatever default system voice is set, ignoring voice parameter.
Speed parameter is not yet available.

The `export` method is not available.


## Linux Notes

Linux support involves the use of [Festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), which uses decidedly less friendly names for its voices.  Voices for
Festival sometimes need to be installed separately - you can check which voices are available by starting up Festival in interactive mode, typing `(voice_`,
and pressing `TAB`.  Then take the name of the voice you'd like to try, minus the parentheses, and pass it in to say.js.

The `export` method is not yet available.

Try the following command to install Festival as well as a default voice:

```shell
sudo apt-get install festival festvox-kallpc16k
```


## Requirements

* Mac OS X (comes with `say`)
* Linux with Festival installed
* Windows (comes with SAPI.SpVoice)
